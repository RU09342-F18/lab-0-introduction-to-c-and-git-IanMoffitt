The math function is instantiated by calling upon the function and passing in 2 integers and the operation desired.
An Example of this is:
   
   math(1,5,+)

The math function is capable of running the following operations using the character listed as the operator passed in
Operation       Char
--------------------
Addition        +
Subtratction    -
Multiplication  *
Division        /
Modulus         %
Left Shift      <
Right Shift     >
Bitwise AND     &
Bitwise OR      |
Bitwise XOR     ^
Bitwise NOT     ~

Once again it should be noted that only integers can be passed in and operated on
